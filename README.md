# image-scraper
Image scraper for DuckDuckGo and Google for creating deep learning datasets

This allows you to run a bunch of searches and download images into folders based on label name. \
You can then run a very simple image cleaner in the notebook to delete anything which doesn't belong. \
Then it zips them up so you can download the dataset or transfers it to google drive.

Version 2:
DuckDuckGo searches can now have params for image size, image type, image layout and image color.
